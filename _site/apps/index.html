Once your work is out in the market, Published! can monitor how many days a piece of work stays out in the market. Use it to track multiple revisions to your workâ€“ both as an independent piece of work, and as a revision of an earlier work. With its powerful accounting module, accurately track revenues and royalties arising from submissions. Its powerful reporting system keeps you organized.</p>

This app. is also useful for recording ancestry and for creating family timelines and genealogy charts: family members can easily share personal timelines with each other via email, and by grouping, create consolidated family timelines. Writers and authors will find this app useful in creating timelines for their characters. Lawyers and Law students will find it useful in recording case law. Time March is also useful in recording medical symptoms and personal medical treatment plans. In fact in any situation that events in chronological order are to be recorded, Time March will be found useful.</p>
