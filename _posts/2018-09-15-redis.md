# Install Windows Version

Officially, Redis is not supported on Windows

[Memurai for Windows](https://www.memurai.com/) : Paid version

> Memurai will have a tiered pricing scheme that will fit different users' needs. The details are not available yet, but there will be a free edition aimed at development use.

[Download Redis  (Windows) ](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/tag/win-3.2.100)

> This release is based on antirez/redis/3.2.1 plus some Windows specific fixes. It has passed all the standard tests but it hasn't been tested in a production environment. Released on Jul 1, 2016

Microsoft port of Redis ( Jul 01 2016): https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows

**Installing the version downloaded  from** [Download Redis  (Windows) ](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/tag/win-3.2.100)

- Extract the zip to prepared directory
- run `redis-server.exe` OR redis-server.exe --maxheap 2gb 

![](..\assets\redis1.png)

- then run redis-cli.exe

  ![](..\assets\redis2.png)

```powershell
set greeting "hello world"
get greeting

#delete a key
del greeting
```



# Overview

Redis is an open source key-value store that stores its data in memory (by default)

* Extremely fast
* Stores more than strings:  strings, ordered lists
* Persistence (can be persisted to disk)
* Replication 
* LUA scripting support



# Redis Datatypes

* String :  should be < 512 mg of space. Store serialized objects
* List
* Set: single instance of a value
* Hashes : multiple fields, multiple values
* Sorted sets

# Strings

1. Set
2. Get
3. Append
4. INCR and DECR
5. GETRANGE (works like substr) :getrange <key>  <startindex> <endindex>  
6. MGET : gets multiple keys set with MSET
7. MSET: sets multiple keys/values: mset key 1 value 1 key 2 value2
8. STRLEN

```powershell
set user1 "{'name' : 'joe', 'email' : 'joe@gmail.com'}"
get user1
```



# Lists

A sorted list of strings, sorted by insertion order

1. LPUSH (prepend) and RPUSH (append): adds items to left side or right side of list.
2. LREM: remove elements from list.
3. LSET: set a value in list based on supplied index.
4. LINDEX: return item by an index.
5. LRANGE: get a range of elements from a list.
6. LLEN: get the length of a list.
7. LPOP and RPOP: remove and get the leftmost and rightmost items of a list. (to simulate a queue: lpop and then rpush)
8. LTRIM: trim the list to a specified range. (ltrim 0 4)

List is efficient when you pull from front or end of a list (using it like a queue or a stack). There is no command to get all items of a list as that would be inefficient (it is a linked list: each item has a pointer to the previous item). You have to provide a range. 

~~~powershell
#add an item to a list
rpush gcf "{'gcf_id': '1','type':'plane', 'name':'plane1', x' : '10', 'y' : '20', 'z' : '15'}"
rpush gcf "{'gcf_id': '1','type':'plane','name':'plane2', x' : '11', 'y' : '21', 'z' : '15'}"
rpush gcf "{'gcf_id': '1','type':'plane','name':'plane3', x' : '12', 'y' : '22', 'z' : '17'}"

#get items
lrange gcf 0 10

#get item at an index not very efficient on large lists
lindex gcf 1

~~~



# Sets

Collection of unique strings. Don't have to check if an element already exists. Set will ignore item if it already exists.

* sadd: add member to a set
* scard: returns number of members in a set
* sdiff, sinter and sunion:  difference, intersection and union operations
* sismember:  checks if a value a member of a set or not.
* smembers: returns all members of a set
* smove: move members from one set to another.
* srem: remove one or more items from a set



```powershell
#add
sadd geometrycolor "blue" "red" "white"
sadd materialcolor "black" "red" "purple"
#count
scard geometrycolor
#members
smembers geometrycolor
#difference between two sets -> white, blue
sdiff geometrycolor materialcolor
#intersection -> red
sinter geometrycolor materialcolor
#union
sunion geometrycolor materialcolor
```



# Hashes

Maps between string fields and values. Redis is optimized for Hashes & hashes are an efficient way to store data in Redis.

* hset: set a value

* hmset: set multiple values

* hget: get

* hmget: get multiple

* hgetall: all keys & values in a hash

* hdel: delete

* hexists: check if key exists

* hincrby: increments value of an integer key

* hkeys: return all keys

* hvals: return all values

  

~~~powershell

#on hash  called h_gcf, set id = 1
hset ht_gcf id "1"
hset ht_gcf plane1 "{'type':'plane', x' : '10', 'y' : '20', 'z' : '15'}"
hset ht_gcf plane2 "{'type':'plane', x' : '12', 'y' : '22', 'z' : '16'}"

#get
hget ht_gcf id
hget ht_gcf plane1

#get multiple 
hmget  ht_gcf id plane1 plane2

# can all use hgetall to get all
hgetall ht_gcf

#get all keys
hkeys ht_gcf
~~~

# Sorted Sets

* zadd : add a member

* zcard : get number of members in a set

* zcount: count members in set with scores in a specified range

* zincrby: increment score of a member in a set

* zrange: returns range by index

* zrank: determines index of member in a set

* zrem: removes members

* zscore: returns score for an item in a set

  

  ```powershell
  #Example: high scores <score> <key>
  zadd hs 120 "joe" 100 "bob" 150 "mary" 90 "tim"
  # get range
  zrange hs 0 4
  #range with scores
  zrange hs 0 4 WITHSCORES
  #update a score
  zadd hs 125 "joe"
  #check ranks
  zrank hs "bob"
  #check score
  zscore "tim"
  
  ```

  

# Pub And Sub

Channel 1 :  open cli in window 1. Subscribes to a channel called greeting

```powershell
#subscribe to greetings channel
subscribe greetings

#subscribe to all channels starting with greet
psubscribe greet*

#unsubscribe
unsubscribe greetings
punsubscribe greet*
```



Channel 2:  open cli in window 2: publishes to a channel called greeting

```powershell
publish greetings "hello"
```



# Transactions

multi : starts a transaction

----do some work

exec: executes the transaction 



# POC using C# Client
