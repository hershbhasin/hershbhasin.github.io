I am a Senior Architect with [Harman International](https://www.harman.com/) (a Samsung Company), designing the CloudworX Configuration Management Application for the Harman suite of audio/video products. We are building a propriety IOT communication  solution which all Harman a/v products (which includes Harman Kardon, JBL, AMX, Revel) will use to communicate with each other and to the cloud. Using this tool, thousands of audio-video and conference room products deployed in Universities, Churches, Concert Theaters, and the Grammys! can be configured and deployed from the Cloud.
