+Ok, let's provision an event hub. This would be the river in which our events would flow. 



I'll click on create a resource which takes me to  the Azure Market place

Here I can search for an event hub

Click create

I'll  call it mywonderfuleventhub

I'll  use the standard pricing tier

And place it in a new resource group

I'll call it rg-poc

I'll select the   central us region because that's the region I am in.

And then click create.







Run Script

Now as we can see we have a Event hub, a SQL Server and a database 

(click on SQL Server, then sql databases) called devicedb

(click on devicedb, then query editor at top, under overview)

Lets log into the query editor and create a table

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[AuditTable](
    [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [device] [varchar](50) NULL,
    [tenant] [varchar](50) NULL,
    project [varchar](50) NULL,
    [username] [varchar](50) NULL,
    [action] [varchar](150) NULL,
    [tshirtcolor] [varchar](150) NULL,
    [EventEnqueuedUtcTime] [datetime] NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]

(expand tables and dbo.audittable)

Great we have a table called AuditTable where Azure Stream Analytics will pump data.Â¬
